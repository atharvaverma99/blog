So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Chinese authorities have accused the UK of sheltering a “criminal suspect” after it granted asylum to Hong Kong activist and former politician Nathan Law.
Law, who fled Hong Kong in 2020, said on Wednesday he had been granted political asylum by the Home Office and the warrant for his arrest under the Beijing-imposed national security law showed he was “exposed to severe political persecution”. At least 100 pro-democracy figures have been arrested under the law.

Figures released on Friday show more than 10,200 people have been arrested over the mass protests that swept Hong Kong in 2019.
On Thursday, Zhao Lijian, spokesman for China’s ministry of foreign affairs, said Law was a “criminal suspect wanted by the Hong Kong police”.

Figures released on Friday show more than 10,200 people have been arrested over the mass protests that swept Hong Kong in 2019.
On Thursday, Zhao Lijian, spokesman for China’s ministry of foreign affairs, said Law was a “criminal suspect wanted by the Hong Kong police”.“We firmly oppose the harbouring of criminals in any form by any country, organisation or individual,” Zhao said. “If the UK openly endorses those seeking Hong Kong independence and shelters wanted suspects, it will constitute gross interference in Hong Kong’s judicial affairs and a breach of international law and basic norms governing international relations.”

Law is among a number of overseas figures wanted by Hong Kong authorities over alleged national security offences, as defined under the broad and widely criticised law imposed by Beijing that criminalised acts of dissent as secession, sedition, foreign collusion and terrorism.
Law first came to prominence during the 2014 “umbrella movement” before forming the now-disbanded Demosisto political party. He fled Hong Kong in late June, saying he left because he faced “unknown dangers” under the new law and because he had spoken to the US Congress about the crisis. His Demosisto co-founders, Agnes Chow and Joshua Wong, have since been jailed, as have dozens of other significant democracy figures and hundreds of civilian protesters as part of the deepening crackdown on all forms of opposition to Beijing’s rule.
Just a quarter of the 10,000 arrested over the 2020 protests – 2,521 people – have seen any judicial proceedings begin, according to statistics released by Hong Kong departments to legislators on Friday. Less than half of those cases have been completed, resulting in 614 convictions, 186 acquittals, and 50 withdrawals of charges, according to the South China Morning Post.
On Twitter, Law said he hoped his case would increase the UK Home Office’s understanding of the “complicated situation in Hong Kong”.
“Some may not have enough evidence to substantiate their claims due to lack of media reports or fleeing before the persecution. Fears over their claims being denied, most of them live in distress and anxiety.”</p>

                The then joint commissioner of the Mumbai Police’s crime branch had opposed Param Bir Singh’s move to appoint Sachin Vaze to head the CIU but was overruled, says police commissioner Hemant Nagrale’s report to the government
                By Surendra P Gangan
                UPDATED ON APR 07, 2021 09:54 PM IST
                Suspended assistant police inspector (API) Sachin Vaze was posted in the crime intelligence unit (CIU) in June last year on the insistence of former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh despite opposition from a top crime branch officer and reported directly to the former police chief, according to a report sent by Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale to the Maharashtra government.According to the Mumbai police chief’s report seen by HT, Vaze bypassed protocol and hierarchy to directly report to Param Bir Singh who practically took all critical decisions relating to arrests, raids, remand applications and the police stand on anticipatory bail in cases handled by Sachin Vaze’s team.

                “Vaze used to accompany Param Bir Singh during the briefing to the minister, home, on critical cases including TRP scam, Antilia explosive scare, Dilip Chhabria’s arrest. Vaze never obeyed the hierarchy of ranks to report over the cases under investigation,” the document said.Officials said the police commissioner was told to send the report to the home department after Sachin Vaze’s arrest.

                Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on March 13 for his alleged role in planting a vehicle with 20 loose gelatin sticks near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia. He is the prime suspect in the murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, who is linked to the vehicle found near Antilia. This case is also being investigated by the NIA.

                The police commissioner’s report, which is seen to link Param Bir Singh to the controversial police officer Sachin Vaze, immediately prompted calls to put the former city police chief’s role under scrutiny.

                On Wednesday, the NIA summoned Param Bir Singh for questioning in the two cases. Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said this was something they had been demanding for days, because of Param Bir Singh’s “close proximity” with arrested API Vaze.It has now been established that Singh is as responsible as Vaze in these two cases,” the Congress leader said.

                Singh was removed as police commissioner on March 17 and shifted as commandant general of home guards. Param Bir Singh ignited a political storm soon after, with a letter to Uddhav Thackeray accusing the then home minister Anil Deshmukh of corruption. Singh later approached the Supreme Court and high court too. On Monday, Deshmukh finally had to resign after the Bombay high court asked the CBI to hold a preliminary inquiry into the allegation.

                Police Commissioner Hemant Nagrale’s report, sought by the home department while Deshmukh was still home minister, also links Param Bir Singh to the decision to revoke Sachin Vaze’s suspension.“The decision about the reinstatement of Vaze was taken in a suspension review committee meeting on June 5, 2020, chaired by Singh, joint police commissioner (administration) and other two senior officers. Vaze was reinstated on June 9 and was given posting in CIU, after initial appointment in the armed unit,” the report said, pointing that the then joint commissioner (Crime) had strongly opposed Vaze’s posting in the CIU.

                It said Param Bir Singh ensured that Vaze headed the CIU though he, unlike other police officers who led the crucial unit in the past, was not an inspector-rank officer.</p>
